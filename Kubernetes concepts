kuberneters having following structure 

1.cluster
2.nodes 
3.pod
4.container
5.application

docker have 
*********
1.cluster
2.nodes
3.container
4.application

Note: K8's don't know communicate with containers 
it communicate with pods. 

Components:
=========
Master Node :
1. API cluster : it;s for communicating with cluster , it takes command executes and give output . 
2. ETCD :its a DB of cluster , all the info will store here . 
3. SCHEDULER:scheduler pod on worker node based on hardware resources . 
4. CONTROLLER: used to control the k8's objects . 
  1. cloud controller :  
  2. cube controller : 

Worker Node : 
===========
kubelet : its an agent to communicate with the master  . 
kubeproxy : it is used to deal with network 
POD : group of containers 


MINIKUBE :

it is used to setup single node cluster on k8's 

MINIKUBE REQUIREMENTS :
********************
2 cpu 
2gb RAM 
20 gb space 
internet connection 
container or virtual machine manager like docker
